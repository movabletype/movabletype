=head1 NAME

SOAP::Client - exists purely as a superclass for client classes declared by the various SOAP::Lite transport modules.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The SOAP::Client class exists purely as a superclass for client classes
declared by the various SOAP::Lite transport modules. The methods it
provides are all simple accessors; they return the current value when
called with no arguments or set the attribute value and return the object
reference when called with an argument. These attributes include:

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item code, message, status

Stores the response code, message, and status from the most-recent send attempt. For some protocols, such as FTP, the same value is used for all three because of the lack of finer-grained detail (the default is to ensure that all three attributes contain data, even if redundant). Other protocols (such as HTTP) have distinct values in each.

=item endpoint

Identifies the current endpoint to which messages are being sent. This should match the value of the transport method from the L<SOAP::Transport> class, but setting this doesn't propagate to the transport object. It is better to use the transport object (or the shortcut via the SOAP::Lite object itself) when setting this.

=item is_success

The success or failure of the most-recent transmission is noted here as a boolean value.

=item options

The options attribute keeps a hash-table reference of additional  options and their values. At present, only one option is used by any of the transport modules:

=over

=item compress_threshold

The value of this option should be a numerical value. If set, and if the Compress::Zlib library is available, messages whose size in bytes exceeds this value will be compressed before sending. Both ends of the conversation must have it enabled.

=back

Other options may be defined using this mechanism. Note that setting the options using this accessor requires a full hash reference be passed. To set just one or a few values, consider retrieving the current reference value and using it to set the key(s).
