=head1 NAME

SOAP::Header - similar to SOAP::Data elements, a SOAP::Header object simply is encoded in the SOAP Header block

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects instantiated from the SOAP::Header class are functionally the same as SOAP::Data objects, and as such share all the methods from that class. The distinction may be cosmetic, but it is present so that applications may more easily distinguish header blocks from more generic data elements.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<SOAP::Data>

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Special thanks to O'Reilly publishing which has graciously allowed SOAP::Lite to republish and redistribute large excerpts from I<Programming Web Services with Perl>, mainly the SOAP::Lite reference found in Appendix B.
